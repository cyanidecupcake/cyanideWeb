			<p><a href="http://www.hear-me.net/hearme_101">Hear Me 101</a> is a year-long program based in public schools located in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Over the course of a school year students create short documentaries from concept to final cut.  Hear Me 101 guides students as they investigate issues affecting their schools and their communities, allowing their voices to be heard by policy makers.</p>

			<p>Hear Me 101 is a program of Carnegie Mellon University's CREATE Lab. Weichler came on-board in 2012 through their partnership with Pittsburgh Filmmakers and worked alongside them at McKeesport, Steel Valley, and Clairton High Schools til 2014.</p>
