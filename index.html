			<h1>about conductive paintings.</h1>

			<p><b><i>"love letter to Pittsburgh" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2015</i></b></p>
			<p><i>Made with electronics, code, and conductive paint this artwork is a love letter to Pittsburgh, where rivers converge and technology reigns.</i></p><br><br>

			<p>Jess developed the idea of creating interactive paintings in 2014 after purchasing far too much conductive paint for a class.  With the leftovers she created her first conductive painting which consisted of 2D musical instruments that could be played by the viewer. </p><br>

<p>To activate a conductive painting viewers must become a living circuit: Placing one hand on the painted hand representing "ground" while at the same time touching other parts of the painting.  This completes a circuit and sends an electrical pulse to the programme that plays each sound.</p><br>

<p>For a more collaborative approach viewers can join hands with a friend to see if the electricity will still flow.</p><br>

			<p>Conductive paintings are much more than art, they also teach the basics of electricity in a tangible and fun way.</p><br>

			<p>Conductive paintings are the creation of Jess Weichler.  She designs each one from scratch then paints them on canvas using acrylic and conductive paint, tissue paper, and wire.
		<br><br>

			Her partner, <a href="http://slackermedia.info">Klaatu</a>, then attaches the wires to a MaKey MaKey which allows the painting to register each "touch".  The MaKey MaKey is then hooked up to a Raspberry Pi running a custom made Python programme.
		<br><br>
		The box housing all the electronic components was imagined by Jess then perfected and laser cut by <a href="http://thaumaturgy.co.nz">Wolf Hatch</a> of the Wellington Makerspace in Wellington, NZ.
		<br><br>
		Many of the sounds used are from freesound.org, an Open Source, Creative Commons sound library.  Others are entirely original, created by Klaatu and Jess using the Open Source programme <a href="audacity.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">Audacity</a>, <a href="http://qtractor.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">Qtractor</a>, and the <a href="http://calf.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">CALF</a> effect plugins.</p>
