			<p>I am a self-proclaimed life-long learner, always seeking out new media to stretch my abilities.  Since graduating from <a href="http://www.pointpark.edu">Point Park University</a> in 2009 I have enrolled myself in pottery classes, a web design course, and attended every workshop I could get my hands on.  I have also sought out fellow learners to both learn from and share my expertise with.</p><br><br>  

			<p>In 2014 I hope to teach myself Flash animation and explore the possibilities of merging Scratch and MaKey MaKey with basic circuit building and woodworking.</p><br><br>

			
			<h1>Maker Boot Camp</h1>
			<div class="bootCamp">	
				<p>In 2009 I was one of a select few to be accepted into a four-day, hands-on, Maker Boot Camp at the <a href="http://pittsburghkids.org">Pittsburgh Children's Museum</a>.  Throughout the week I learned how to work with textiles, circuitry, wood, and digital coding programs.  Personally, I found the circuitry workshops to be the most engaging and was excited to learn how to solder.<br><br>

On the last day of boot camp we split off into small groups, each group was given three pieces of paper with parameters that we were expected to fufill, and 45 minutes to create.  Given the peramaters of tear, nail, and recycled packaging we created a kenetic, musical sculpture, which all three group members promptly dropped in the last minute of the exercise.  Happily for us, there are no mistakes in making, only learning experiences, and we won the "Best Mishap" award.</p>

			<h1>Webdesign, Programming, and Robotics</h1>
			<p>Since I was a child I have had an interest in programming.  Growing up in a house with no internet I often would design "websites" and educational "games" for my little sister in Microsoft Word and MS Paint.  There was no real coding to speak of, just images on a screen, but the passion was there.</p><br>

			<p>As an adult, I have created websites for myself and friends using HTML and CSS.  I have also explored the world of video game programming and robotics through open-source programs <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, Processing, and Visual Programmer for the Hummingbird Robotics Kit.  As for hardware, I enjoy exploring the limitations of the <a href="http://www.makeymakey.com">MaKey MaKey</a>, <a href="http://hummingbirdkit.com">Hummingbird</a>, <a href="http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/apthomas/SquishyCircuits/index.htm">Squishy Circuits</a>, and <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p><br>

			<p>My most adventurous project has been Timmy, a cookie fetching robot that utilizes both the Hummingbird and the Raspberry Pi.  He is still a work in progress, but I am very proud of how far he has come.</p><br><br><br>

			<p>My formal, university training is as a filmmaker and I have worked on short films and commercial television productions alike.  Though I am knowledgable in all aspects of filmmaking my specialty is digital editing.</p><br><br>
