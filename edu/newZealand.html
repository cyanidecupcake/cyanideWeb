			<p>At the beginning of 2014 I moved to Wellington, New Zealand with the desire to continue the work I began in Pittsburgh.  I believe strongly in providing high-quality, affordable courses to all students that help them stretch their imaginations and grow their skills.</p><br>

				<p><b>Bubble Dome</b><br>
				Through <a href="http://www.bubbledome.co.nz">Bubble Dome</a> I taught a course in web design and app development.  During this four day course, students learned how to code websites using HTML and CSS and created two applications using the Processing programming language. Through the class students were also introduced to GIMP as they created their own unique sprites.<br><br>

On the last day of class, the students had ideas on how to make their applications even better, but we did not have time to cover this extra material in class.  To bridge the gap between the app the kids had and the app they desired, I created a <a href="http://www.cyanidecupcake.com/class/code.html">website</a> filled with tutorials that they could complete at home.</p><br><br><br>
